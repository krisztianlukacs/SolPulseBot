**Project Title: Real-Time Monitoring Tool for Smart Contracts with Telegram Alerts**

**Project Description:**

This project aims to build a real-time monitoring tool for smart contracts that automatically tracks state changes and sends notifications via Telegram. The goal is to provide a user-friendly, efficient way for developers and stakeholders to stay informed about the dynamic state changes occurring within a smart contract (or program) without the need to manually check the blockchain for updates.

The tool will use Python and leverage the WebSocket API to establish a connection to a RPC node. Upon detecting any updates related to a specific smart contract, it will trigger a real-time alert through a Telegram bot, ensuring that users are promptly notified of critical state changes.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The tool listens for changes in the state of a given smart contract using a WebSocket connection, providing real-time data.
- **Programmable Alerts:** Alerts will be generated whenever there is an event or state update, such as account balance changes, token transfers, or custom events defined by the smart contract.
- **Telegram Integration:** The system is integrated with Telegram, which allows for direct and instant notifications to subscribed users, making it easy to stay informed on the go.
- **User-Defined Smart Contracts:** Users can specify which smart contracts they wish to monitor, providing flexibility and customization according to individual needs.

**Technical Approach:**

- **Python & WebSocket Integration:** The project utilizes Python's `websocket-client` and smart contract library for interfacing with the blockchain in real time.
- **Subscription Mechanism:** By subscribing to a specific smart contract address using the WebSocket API, the tool listens for all state changes related to that contract.
- **Event Handling and Notifications:** Whenever a change is detected, the WebSocket client triggers an event, and the tool sends a corresponding notification via a Telegram bot.

**Project Impact:**
This tool is ideal for blockchain developers, DeFi project teams, and anyone working with smart contracts who needs to be updated instantly when significant changes occur. It eliminates the need to manually query blockchain data and offers a streamlined, automated solution for staying informed.

The proposed solution can be particularly useful for:

- **DeFi Projects:** Monitoring liquidity pool balances or other important metrics.
- **NFT Projects:** Tracking the state of minting contracts or updates related to NFTs.
- **Auditing Purposes:** Providing an audit trail for real-time contract updates to ensure transparency and security.

**Why This Project?**
In a fast-paced environment like blockchain, real-time information is crucial for making informed decisions. Missing a critical update can lead to lost opportunities or vulnerabilities. By automating smart contract monitoring and linking it to an immediate messaging platform like Telegram, this project aims to significantly enhance both developer productivity and user experience.

**Technologies Used:**

- **WebSocket API** for real-time blockchain data access.
- **Python** for core implementation.
- **WebSocket-Client Library** to handle WebSocket connections.
- **Telegram Bot API** for sending alerts directly to users.

**Target Audience:**
This project is suited for blockchain enthusiasts, developers, security experts, and teams participating in a hackathon interested in building tools around blockchain monitoring, real-time notifications, and smart contract applications. It offers an exciting opportunity to explore blockchain data streams and learn more about integrating blockchain technology with common messaging services.

**Project Opportunities:**
Hackathon participants can expand on the project by adding:

- A **frontend dashboard** for easier monitoring.
- **Custom filtering logic** to receive only specific types of updates.
- **Support for multiple blockchains**, making it a versatile, cross-chain monitoring tool.

This project not only solves a practical problem but also provides an excellent learning experience in real-time data processing, blockchain technology, and Telegram bot integration.
